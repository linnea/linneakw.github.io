		<h1>REFLECTIONS & PRESENTATIONS</h1>
		<hr></hr>
		<h2>REFLECTIONS</h2>
		<h2>10/6/14</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Based on the group of articles you read for 10/6, how does diversity impact innovation and productivity?  Does this ring true to you? Do you have any examples to share?  Please reference specific articles, as appropriate.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Diversity impacts innovation and productivity because it allows people to bring different ways of seeing things to the table. Diversity allows a wide variety of solutions to arise, to more quickly and efficiently discover solutions to problems. Like Scott E. Page discusses in his book, “The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools and Societies” if we are all raised and taught the same, we will likely encounter the same problems. But as soon as a diverse group of people is brought together, it allows for variability in where we get stuck in certain problems, and how we can help each other grow in different ways (Page).</p>

		<p>This rings true to me, because being a women in the field of informatics has opened me up to many different opportunities that I wouldn’t have experienced otherwise. Women are now being introduced and welcomed in the field of computer science, and with that arises many opportunities for women to explore more. By introducing women into this field, I have brought to the table my own inherent diversity (Hewlett, Marshall, & Sherbin) and a different set of experience within my classes that have helped look at problems in different ways.  </p>
		<h2>10/13/14</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>What is Big Data and what can you do with it?  Look through all the readings and highlight 3 examples of the use of information that you found impressive/interesting.  Why did these impress/interest you?</li></ul>
		<p>
		Big Data is massive amounts of information collected through many different means which is used to provide information for organizations and businesses to improve in almost every way. Companies who don’t take advantage of this leap in data gathering and analysis will most likely be left in the dust.  The three examples that impressed me most about how Big Data is being used is UPS driving instructions, the Quantified Self running app, and smart contact lenses by Google. </p>
		<p>
		The first example is in regards to UPS using data to discover that it is more time-efficient to never take a left turn. This interested me because I had no idea UPS operated that way, or tracked and timed their deliveries so efficiently. The next example of Big Data that impressed me was the Quantified Self idea of self-monitoring for your own personal well-being. I was very interested in the idea of a sock or shoe that would gather data to improve how I run. The last example of Big Data I found interesting was the smart contact lenses. I am terrified of becoming diabetic because I have a fear of needles and checking my own blood. I have constantly wondered how people do that every day, and the fact that there’s a harmless solution to that problem interests me greatly.</p>

		<h2>10/15/14</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Think about the phrase “Just for me.”  How does this “granularity of targeting” connect to Big Data, and how has the travel industry been impacted by the Internet and “Just for me” approach to travel.</li>
			<li>Based on our readings, how can technology help society?  If you could use technology to solve any world problem, what problem would you solve?  At a very high level, how might information technology solve that problem?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The travel industry has been impacted by the Internet because of the new ways people are starting to look for information. Travel industries are finding out that more and more people use search engines and social media to find information about their travel destination, tourist locations, and ratings on hotels, and other attractions. The travel industry is realizing it needs to utilize big data to find out what people are looking for, and provide ammenities that are targetted towards people looking into their services. </p>
		<p>According to our readings, technology can help society in many ways, such as; monitoring alchohol levels and keeping people safe in dangerous situations, as well as helping end homelessness in Seattle. If I could use technology to solve any world problem, I would use it to spread knowledge and learning to parts of the world that are struggling with education. Information technology helps solve this problem by providing easily accessed information to a place that would normally have trouble gathering information without technology.</p>
		<h2>PRESENTATION</h2>
		<hr>
		<h2>Interesting Fact</h2>
		<p>Women are underrepresented in the field of technology. According to Lyndsey Gilpin, in “The State of Women in Technology: 15 Data Points You Should Know” there are many different facts describing the lack of women in the computing workforce. Gilpin states “By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer science jobs available in the US according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we need to play catch-up to fill them all” (Gilpin, para 1). With all of these new positions, it’s imperative for women interested in computer science to be more easily integrated into the field, as the added diversity gives many benefits in the workplace. </p>
		<p>With only 12% of Computer Science degrees being earned by women, and around 30-39% of Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and LinkedIn’s employees being women (Gilpin), it is obvious that women aren’t as prevalent as men in the field of computer science. I am happy to become a part of the growing number of women in technology, as I’m actively striving to find a place I can apply my skills and thrive and grow in an innovative environment.
