				    		<p>Dear Adobe Recruiting manager,</p>

							<p>I am extremely excited to submit my application for a Visual Design Internship at Adobe. I am very interested in working for Adobe because of Adobe's principles towards creating a global impact and inspiring creativity. I love knowing that my work is helpful and innovative, and I strive to produce designs that transform data into creative solutions.</p>  

							<p>I have developed many skills that I believe would make me a great fit for working with Adobe through my course work as an Informatics student at the University of Washington. I have skills not only in design, but also with coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (as well as a little experience with Angular and JQuery). Through my coursework, as well as my previous position working as a User Experience designer for an online learning platform, I have created prototypes and wireframes, and final website designs using many different tools such as Sketch, InDesign Axure, and Photoshop.</p>

							<p>I have gained strong communication skills through many group projects and presentations, as well as crucial leadership skills as the Director of Operations in the Informatics Undergraduate Association. I am extremely interested in learning more, and find joy in creating and designing new, intuitive, and creative solutions. I have experience in all phases of design, from paper prototyping and higher fidelity mockups, to creating working and fluid HTML and CSS. I believe I would make an awesome fit for this position because of my ability to combine web development with usable, user-centric solutions.</p>

							<p>As much as I have learned, I feel I have only touched the tip of what it means to be a web designer, and I am very eager and interested to learn more and challenge myself. I am very excited to show you what I have done, and what I can do if given the chance to work on a team with Adobe. I am extremely driven to learn, and am excited about the diverse opportunities Adobe provides. Thank you so much for your consideration, I can be reached at linnea_watson@hotmail.com, or (360) 910-5186 to discuss any questions you may have, and show you more about my work and projects.</p>

							Best Regards,<br>	
							Linnea Watson
