				    		<h1>Group Up</h1><p>
				      		In winter quarter, 2015 I took a class called Design Thinking. The main focus of the class was to create a new design that solves a problem that affects college level juniors and seniors. After being placed in a group with Hannah Yoo and Patrick Harper-Joles, we brainstormed the most pressing problems we face as college students. We struggled to find something that deeply affected all of us. However, eventually we decided on something we’ve all experienced.
							</p><p>
							<strong>Problem:</strong> <i>The inability to connect and form relationships with other students, especially the further in time the quarter progresses.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
							Once we discovered the problem, we could continue on to developing a paper prototype that would solve our design problem and provide a platform for students to connect and communicate more seamlessly.  We wanted to give students to tools to integrate their schedules and availabilities, while taking into account their learning and studying styles, preferred location and amenities, and more.  </p>

				    		<h1>Dub Design</h1><p>
				    		In Fall 2014 I took Women in Informatics, a course that talked about gender and diversity in the tech field. I was assigned the task of redesigning UW's mobile application, and presenting the changes as a proposal to the University of Washington to fund our proposed changes. We began by analyzing the current problems of the application: lack of functionality, maintenance, and user base, as well as an overwhelming amount of features that didn't do anything more than link to external applications. </p>
				    		<p>Because this was the University of Washington's main mobile application, we proposed a redesign that would provide a better experience to UW's students, guests, and faculty. We redesigned the app with features that were personalized to the user and had quicker access to more usable features that its users wanted. </p>
				    		<p>After researching and surveying a group of students, and interviewing professors, we set out with a new design that added customized, attractive features for a diverse variety of users.</p>

				    		<h1>Camera & Gallery App</h1>
				      		<p>In Winter 2014 I took the course Mobile App Design. In this course I was given a wide variety of opportunities to design. I worked in an agile form of sprints, first creating a design language, then deciding gestures and interactions, the Browser & Maps application, and a Camera & Gallery application based around a chosen design language.</p><p>
				      		The course gave me immmeasurable experience in  design and user experience. This particular example outlines my group's final project, the Camera and Gallery Application. We designed around the design language "Orbit", which was chosen by the class and centered around the idea of orbital and radial menus.</p><p>My team mainly focused on the Gallery application. We decided upon a radial menu approach to sort pictures by attributes such as time, color, and location. After choosing a filter, the user then has the option to select a certain value within that filter (e.g. filter: color, color: orange). Also shown is our image editor, following the design language with radial menus that let you pan through by spinning the corner wheel.

				    		<h1>MammaRo Revamp</h1>
				      		I have been interested in designing and developing for as long as I can remember. I self-taught myself HTML and CSS as a kid, and given the chance looked out for projects and courses I could improve upon. Although I didn't have much design or development experience at the time, I took on the task of redesigning the MammaRo' website in my senior year of high school. </p>

				      		<p>
				      		The website was not very aesthetically pleasing, and was confusing to navigate. There was both a side bar, and a top navigation. I decided to maintain their branding, while still organizing their three branches of products; MammaRo', La Gabbianella , and Ricardo Marzi. I designed a header and top bar that could lead the user to the type of product they were interested in, as well as their news and advertisements, footer with crucial contact information. I also made sure to  keep the PayPal cart integration both at the top and bottom of the page for easy access.</p><p>I learned so much from this project, and pushed myself to create something that would finally be used in real world application. Unfortunately, MammaRo' has since gone out of business. They did not have a developer that knew how to maintain and update css/html, but I was still extremely grateful for the opportunity, and learned so much about interacting and designing for a client rather than just for myself. <br>
